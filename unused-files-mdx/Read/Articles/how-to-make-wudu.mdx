### **1. Make the Intention (Niyyah)**
- **What to Do**: In your heart, make the intention that you are performing wudu to purify yourself for the sake of Allah.
- **Note**: You don’t need to say the intention out loud, as intentions are made in the heart.

### **2. Say "Bismillah"**
- **What to Say**: Begin your wudu by saying:
  - **Arabic**: بِسْمِ اللَّهِ  
  - **Transliteration**: *Bismillah*  
  - **Translation**: "In the name of Allah."

### **3. Wash Your Hands (3 Times)**
- **How to Do It**:
  - Wash both hands up to the wrists thoroughly.
  - Ensure water reaches between your fingers and around your nails.

### **11. Recite the Du’a (Optional but Recommended)**
- After completing wudu, recite the following du’a:

**Arabic**:  
    اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ 

**Transliteration**:  
    *Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah, wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluh.* 

**Translation**:  
    "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone; He has no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger."
  
**Additional Du’a**:  
    اللّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ  
    *Allahumma aj‘alni min at-tawwabeen, waj‘alni min al-mutatahhireen.*  
    **Translation**: "O Allah, make me among those who repent often and purify themselves."

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Order (Tartib)**: Perform the steps of wudu in the proper order.
2. **Continuity (Muwalat)**: Do not delay between washing different parts.

   - Wash the face once.

   However, performing each step three times is preferred (Sunnah).

### **Why Is Wudu Important?**
- Wudu purifies your body and soul, preparing you to stand before Allah.
- The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
  > *When a Muslim performs wudu, and washes his face, every sin he looked at with his eyes is washed away with the water. When he washes his hands, every sin they touched is washed away with the water. When he washes his feet, every sin toward which he walked is washed away with the water, until he emerges purified from sin.*  
  *(Sahih Muslim: 244)*

May Allah accept your wudu and grant you purity in this world and the Hereafter. Ameen.
