title: Chapter 4 - The Creation of Adam (AS)
description: The Creation of the Angels, Jinn, and the Unseen Worl
---

## 🌍 **1. The Plan to Create the First Human**

Allah informed the angels:

> **"Indeed, I am going to place upon the earth a khalifah (successor, vicegerent)."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:30)

The angels respectfully asked:
> **"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption and sheds blood, while we glorify You and praise You?"**  
Allah replied:  
> **"Indeed, I know that which you do not know."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:30)

💡 This shows Allah's **infinite wisdom**—He knew that among the children of Adam would be **prophets, martyrs, scholars, righteous worshippers**, and sincere slaves.

---

## 🧱 **2. How Was Adam (AS) Created?**

> **"He created man from clay like [that of] pottery."**  
> (Surah Ar-Rahman 55:14)

- Allah gathered **clay from all parts of the Earth**—that’s why humans come in **different colors, characters, and natures.**  
- He shaped Adam (AS) **with His own Hands**, with love and care.

> **"What prevented you from prostrating to what I created with My own Hands?"**  
> (Surah Sad 38:75)

After shaping him, Allah **left Adam as a physical body** for some time.

---

## 🌬️ **3. The Soul is Blown – Life Begins**

> **"Then He proportioned him and breathed into him from His [created] soul..."**  
> (Surah As-Sajdah 32:9)

When the soul reached his **head**, Adam (AS) sneezed and said:
> **"Alhamdulillah (All praise is to Allah)"**

And Allah responded:
> **"Yarhamuk Allah (May Allah have mercy on you)."**  
(Hadith – Sahih Muslim)

🌟 This was the **first word ever spoken by a human**: **Praise to Allah.**

---

## 🧠 **4. The Knowledge Given to Adam (AS)**

> **"And He taught Adam the names of all things..."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:31)

- Adam (AS) was given **intellect, speech, memory, and understanding.**  
- Allah then asked the **angels to name those things**, but they said:

> **"We have no knowledge except what You have taught us..."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:32)

This was to show that **Adam had a special honor and role.**

---

## 🤲 **5. The Command to Prostrate to Adam**

> **"So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down in prostration to him."**  
> (Surah Al-Hijr 15:29)

- The angels **all obeyed** the command.  
- But **Iblis refused.**

---

## ❌ **6. Iblis Rebels Out of Arrogance**

> **"He refused, was arrogant, and became one of the disbelievers."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:34)

Iblis said:

> **"I am better than him. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."**  
> (Surah Al-A’raf 7:12)

💣 This was the first **racism, pride, and disobedience**—Iblis felt **superior** because of what he was created from.

---

## 🧨 **7. Allah Curses Iblis**

> **"Get down from it! You are not to be arrogant here. Get out! Indeed, you are of the humiliated."**  
> (Surah Al-A’raf 7:13)

Iblis was **cast out of Paradise**, **deprived of Allah's mercy**, and **sealed in his hatred.**

He asked for **respite (time) until the Day of Judgment**—and Allah granted it.

---

## 🔥 **8. Shaytan’s Promise to Misguide**

> **"Because You have misled me, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path..."**  
> (Surah Al-A'raf 7:16-17)

Iblis swore to:
- **Whisper from front, back, left, and right**  
- **Make evil seem beautiful**  
- **Lead people to sin, shirk, pride, laziness, and delay**

But he admitted:

> **"Except Your sincere servants among them – I can’t harm them."**

---

## 🧕🏽 **9. The Creation of Hawwa (Eve)**

- While Adam (AS) was in Paradise, **Allah created Hawwa (AS)** from him—so he would have a partner.

> **"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate..."**  
> (Surah An-Nisa 4:1)

- They lived in Jannah, with **peace and blessings**, but were given **one clear rule**.

> **"Do not come near this tree..."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:35)
