title: Chapter 2 - The Divine Decree
description: The Pen, Qadar, and the Unseen Plan of Allah
---

## 📌 **1. The Beginning of Destiny – The First Creation: The Pen (Al-Qalam)**

The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **"The first thing that Allah created was the Pen. He said to it, ‘Write.’ The Pen said, ‘What should I write?’ Allah said: ‘Write what will happen until the Day of Judgment.’"**  
> (Sunan Abu Dawood 4700 – Sahih)

This Pen is **not like any pen we know**—it was created before any universe, any angel, or any human. Its task was not drawing or art—**it wrote everything that will ever happen.**

📌 This includes:
- Every soul that will be born  
- Every breath taken  
- Every leaf that will fall  
- Every word, tear, moment—**all written with divine wisdom**

---

## 📖 **2. What is Qadar (Divine Decree)?**

**Qadar (القدر)** means **Allah’s perfect knowledge, planning, and control** of everything that happens—**past, present, and future.**

It is one of the **six pillars of Iman (faith):**

> The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **"To believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Qadar, the good and bad of it."**  
> (Sahih Muslim 8)

---

## 🧠 **3. The 4 Levels of Qadar (According to Ahlus Sunnah Scholars):**

**1️⃣ Knowledge (العلم)**  
Allah knows **everything—before it happens.**  
> **“Indeed, Allah knows all things.”**  
> (Surah Al-Anfal 8:75)

**2️⃣ Writing (الكتابة)**  
Everything is written in **Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet).**  
> **"No disaster strikes except that it is written in a Book before We bring it into existence."**  
> (Surah Al-Hadid 57:22)

**3️⃣ Will (المشيئة)**  
Nothing happens except **by Allah’s Will**.  
> **“And you do not will, except that Allah wills.”**  
> (Surah At-Takwir 81:29)

**4️⃣ Creation (الخلق)**  
Allah is the **Creator of all actions**, but humans have **free will** to choose.  
> **“Allah created you and what you do.”**  
> (Surah As-Saffat 37:96)

---

## 💬 **4. Do We Have Free Will or Is Everything Forced?**

This is a **big question**, and Islam gives the most **balanced answer**:

✅ **Yes, Allah knows everything.**  
✅ **Yes, He wrote everything.**  
✅ But **you still choose your actions**—and you are responsible.

> The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **“Everyone will find easy what he was created for.”**  
> (Sahih Muslim 2647)

📌 That means:  
If you choose good, Allah makes it easy for you.  
If you choose evil, Allah allows it but warns you.

---

## ❓ **Can Qadar Be Changed?**

✅ Some parts of Qadar are **fixed (like your death, parents, etc.)**  
✅ Some parts can be **changed through dua, sadaqah, and good deeds.**

> **"Nothing repels Qadar except du'a."**  
> (Tirmidhi 2139 – Hasan)

> **“Whoever wishes to have his rizq (sustenance) increased and his life extended, let him maintain family ties.”**  
> (Sahih Bukhari 5986)

📌 So **du’a is powerful**—not because it surprises Allah, but because it is **part of His plan**. He already knew you would make that dua!

---

## 📜 **5. Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz – The Preserved Tablet**

This is a **divine record** where everything is written:
- All events  
- All souls  
- Every creation's fate  
- Written **before the heavens and earth were created**

> **"Indeed, We have honored it in a Book, well-guarded."**  
> (Surah Al-Buruj 85:21-22)

Only **Allah and His chosen angels** have access to it.

---

## 🔥 **6. Shaytan & Qadar – Does He Know the Future?**

❌ No. Shaytan **doesn’t know Qadar.**  
He only **guesses, whispers, and deceives**.  
Only Allah knows the unseen (Al-Ghayb).

> **“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allah.”**  
> (Surah An-Naml 27:65)

---

## 🌟 **7. How Should You React to Qadar?**

✅ **If something good happens:**  
Say: **Alhamdulillah** and thank Allah.

✅ **If something bad happens:**  
Say: **Qaddar Allah wa ma sha’a fa’al**  
_"Allah has decreed, and He does what He wills."_  
(Sahih Muslim 2664)

> The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **"If something befalls you, do not say: ‘If only I had done this…’ Instead say: ‘Qaddar Allah wa ma sha’a fa’al,’ for ‘if’ opens the door for Shaytan."**  
> (Sahih Muslim 2664)

---

## 🧘 **8. The Comfort of Believing in Qadar**

- You don’t have to carry the **weight of regret** forever.  
- You don’t have to fear the future **because it’s in Allah’s control.**  
- You work hard, make dua, and trust Allah with the result.

> **"Put your trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who trust Him."**  
> (Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:159)

---

## 🛡️ **9. The 6th Pillar of Faith is Your Shield**

Believing in Qadar helps you:
- Stay **strong during loss**
- Stay **humble during success**
- Stay **grateful during blessings**
- Stay **hopeful during hardships**
