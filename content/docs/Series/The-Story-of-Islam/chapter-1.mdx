title: Chapter 1 - Before Creation
description: The Eternal Existence of Allah & The Start of Everything
---

## 🌌 **1. Before Everything – There Was Only Allah**

Before the stars, planets, angels, humans, jinn—**there was only Allah**, without beginning or end.

> **"He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near, and He is All-Knowing of everything."**  
> (Surah Al-Hadid 57:3)

Allah is **not created**, and He doesn’t need a creator.  
He is **not inside time**, He created time.  
He is **not part of the creation**, He existed **before** anything was made.

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **“O Allah, You are the First; there is nothing before You. You are the Last; there is nothing after You.”**  
> (Sahih Muslim 2713)

---

## 🧠 **2. Can Our Minds Understand Allah's Beginning?**

No. We can know **who Allah is**, but not **how** He exists.

> The Prophet ﷺ said:  
> **"Think deeply about the creation of Allah, but do not try to think about Allah Himself, for you will never be able to comprehend Him."**  
> (Tabarani – Hasan)

💭 You can imagine galaxies and oceans—but **Allah is beyond imagination.**  
That’s why He is **Al-Awwal (The First), Al-Qayyum (The Sustainer), Al-Khaliq (The Creator).**

## 👑 **3. The Throne of Allah (Al-‘Arsh)**

One of the **first creations of Allah** is the **‘Arsh (Throne).**

> **"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne..."**  
> (Surah Al-A’raf 7:54)

**📌 What We Know About the Throne:**
- It is the **greatest of all creations.**
- It is **above everything else** in the universe.
- **Allah is above His Throne**, in a way that suits His Majesty (not like creation).
- Under the Throne, there was **water**, as mentioned in the Hadith:

> **“There was Allah, and there was nothing else before Him. His Throne was over water..."**  
> (Sahih Bukhari 7418)

💡 **We don’t worship the Throne—we worship the One above it.**

## 🖊️ **4. The Creation of the Pen (Al-Qalam)**

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **"The first thing that Allah created was the Pen. He said to it, ‘Write.’ It said, ‘What should I write?’ He said, ‘Write what will happen until the Day of Judgment.’"**  
> (Sunan Abu Dawood 4700 – Sahih)

This is the **start of Qadar (Divine Decree)**.  
Everything that will ever happen—every soul born, every leaf that falls, every breath you take—was **written down** by the command of Allah.

---

## 🕓 **5. The Creation of Time**

Time did **not exist** before. Allah created **day and night, sun and moon, movement and space**.

> **"He created the heavens and the earth in six days..."**  
> (Surah Qaf 50:38)

Even the concept of **past, present, and future** only began **after creation**.  
But for Allah, everything is always **known, seen, and controlled.**

> **"To Allah belongs the command before and after..."**  
> (Surah Ar-Rum 30:4)

---

## 🪐 **6. The Creation of the Universe**

From the **One Allah**, came the creation of:
- The **heavens** (7 levels of skies)
- The **earth**
- The **mountains, oceans, light, darkness**
- The **sun, moon, and stars**

> **"It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days..."**  
> (Surah As-Sajdah 32:4)

🔭 Modern science is only now discovering what **Allah already told us in the Quran 1400+ years ago.**

---

## 💡 **7. Why Did Allah Create All This?**

Allah doesn’t need creation—but He made it **as a test**, and to be **recognized and worshipped**.

> **"I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me."**  
> (Surah Adh-Dhariyat 51:56)

We are part of this great plan.  
Everything you see—the stars, sky, time itself—exists so that **you can know your Creator** and **return to Him.**
