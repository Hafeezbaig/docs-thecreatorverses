description: The Eternal Existence of Allah

## 🕊️ **1. Who Was There Before Everything?**

Before the heavens, before the earth, before time, before the angels, jinn, or any creation—**there was only Allah**.

> **"He is the First and the Last, the Most High and the Most Near."**  
> (Surah Al-Hadid 57:3)

- Allah had **no beginning**.  
- He was **not born**, and He **does not die**.  
- **Nothing existed with Him.** Not even the concept of “before” or “after”—because **time itself didn’t exist yet.**

## 🧠 **2. Can We Understand Allah’s Existence Fully?**

Not completely. Allah is beyond the imagination of His creation.

The Prophet ﷺ said:
> **"Reflect upon the creation of Allah, but do not reflect upon Allah Himself, for you will never be able to grasp Him."**  
> (Tabarani – Hasan)

But we do know **He is One, Eternal, Living**, and **has always been there**—without needing anything.

## 🕋 **3. The Names and Attributes of Allah**

Allah has **99 beautiful names** mentioned in the Quran and authentic Sunnah. A few related to this chapter:

- **Al-Awwal (ٱلْأَوَّلُ)** – The First (with no beginning)  
- **Al-Qadeem (القديم)** – The One who existed eternally  
- **Al-Khaliq (الخالق)** – The Creator  
- **Al-Hayy (الحي)** – The Ever-Living  
- **Al-Qayyum (القيوم)** – The One who sustains all

> **"To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent."**  
> (Surah Al-Hadid 57:2)

## 🗓️ **4. What Was There Before the Creation?**

A companion once asked the Prophet ﷺ:

> **“O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He created the creation?”**  
> He ﷺ said:  
> **"He was above the water, and there was nothing under the Throne, and He wrote everything in the Book."**  
> (Sahih Bukhari – part of Hadith Al-Imran, Ibn Majah 4286 – Sahih)

So before anything:
- There was **Allah**
- There was His **Arsh (Throne)**
- There was **water** under the Throne  
- **No heavens, no earth, no time, no space—only Allah and what He willed**

## 🖊️ **5. What Did Allah Create First?**

In the Hadith:
> **"The first thing Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it: Write. It said: What should I write? Allah said: Write everything that will happen until the Day of Judgment."**  
> (Sunan Abu Dawood 4700 – Sahih)

This Pen is not like any pen we know. It wrote down **every moment of existence**, as part of the **Divine Decree (Qadar)**.
