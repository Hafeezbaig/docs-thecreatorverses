## 👼 **1. The Creation of Angels (Mala’ikah)**

Angels were created **before mankind**, and their creation is purely from **light**.

> **The Prophet ﷺ said:**  
> **"The angels were created from light..."**  
> (Sahih Muslim 2996)

### ✨ Characteristics of Angels:
- They **do not eat, drink, or sleep**  
- They **do not disobey Allah**—they are always in full submission  
- They are **genderless**, and do **not reproduce**  
- They have **no free will**  
- They **travel at lightning speed**, perform tasks across the universe  

> **"They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded."**  
> (Surah At-Tahrim 66:6)

---

### 📝 Their Duties:

| Angel | Duty |
|-------|------|
| **Jibreel (AS)** | Delivers revelation to the Prophets  
| **Mikail (AS)** | Controls rain, weather, and sustenance  
| **Israfeel (AS)** | Will blow the Trumpet on the Day of Judgment  
| **Malik** | Guardian of Hell  
| **Munkar & Nakir** | Question the dead in the grave  
| **Raqeeb & Ateed** | Record your good and bad deeds  
| **Angels of Death** | Take souls at death  

There are also **angels that protect you, make dua for you, and witness your worship**—some **only visit during the night**, others during the day.

---

## 🌫️ **2. The World of the Unseen (Al-Ghayb)**

As believers, we must have **Iman bil Ghayb**—faith in the unseen.

> **"Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend from what We have provided them."**  
> (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:3)

The **unseen world** includes:
- Angels
- Jinn
- Shayatin
- Barzakh (life after death)
- Paradise and Hell
- The future (Day of Judgment)
- Divine Decree

Though we can’t see them, **they exist as real as the earth and sky**.

## 🔥 **3. Creation of the Jinn – From Fire**

The jinn were created **before humans**, from **smokeless fire**.

> **"And the jinn We created before [mankind] from scorching fire."**  
> (Surah Al-Hijr 15:27)

The word “jinn” comes from **"janna"**, meaning **hidden**—because they live in a world we cannot see.

---

### 😈 Types of Jinn:
- **Believing Jinn** – Muslims, who obey Allah  
- **Disbelieving Jinn (Shayatin)** – Who follow Iblis  
- **Some are peaceful, others evil, some fly, some walk**

> **"There are among us righteous and among us are [others] not so; we are of various paths."**  
> (Surah Al-Jinn 72:11)

They **eat, drink, marry, have children**, and will be judged like humans in the afterlife.

---

## 🧿 **4. Shaytan (Iblis) – The Enemy of Mankind**

**Iblis** was a **devoted worshipper** among the jinn. Due to his intense worship, he was **allowed to live among the angels**—but **he was never an angel.**

When Allah created Adam (AS), He commanded all to **prostrate out of respect**.

> **"So the angels prostrated—all of them entirely. Except Iblis: he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers."**  
> (Surah Sad 38:73-74)

---

### ❌ Why Did Iblis Refuse?

> **"I am better than him. You created me from fire and him from clay."**  
> (Surah Al-A’raf 7:12)

His refusal was out of:
- **Pride**
- **Jealousy**
- **Arrogance**

Thus, Allah **cursed him forever** and **banished him** from mercy.

---

### 🗡️ His Mission:

Iblis said:
> **"I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path... and You will not find most of them grateful."**  
> (Surah Al-A'raf 7:16-17)

- He asked Allah to **delay his punishment until the Day of Judgment.**
- Allah granted it as a test—for him and us.

## 🛡️ **5. Protection from Shaytan and Jinn**

### How to Protect Yourself:

| Action | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| **Saying Bismillah** | Before eating, entering home, bathroom – blocks jinn  
| **Morning/Evening Adhkar** | Shields your soul  
| **Ayat al-Kursi** | Strongest protection from jinn and evil  
| **Surah Al-Falaq & Surah An-Naas** | Shield from sihr (magic) and waswasah  
| **Reciting Quran** | Makes jinn and shayatin flee  
| **Istighfar and Salah** | Keeps heart protected  

---

## 🔑 **6. Wisdom Behind the Creation of Angels & Jinn**

Allah created:
- **Angels without desires** → pure obedience  
- **Animals with only desires** → no accountability  
- **Humans and jinn with choice** → to be tested

That’s why:
- **You are higher than angels if you obey Allah**  
- **But lower than animals if you follow desires**
